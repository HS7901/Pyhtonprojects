## Create a flow chart first then try to breakdown the steps and find out code for each step:
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
import random
##STEPS:
# STEP - 1 (TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it.)



# TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it
#  is, "Wrong" if it's not.

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

guess = input("guess_a_letter:" .lower())

for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        print("Right")
    else:
        print("wrong")

STEP2 - (# TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.)
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

placeholder = ""
word_legnth = len(chosen_word)
for positions in range(word_legnth):
    placeholder +="_"
print(placeholder)
guess = input("guess_a_letter:" .lower())
display = ""

for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        display += letter
    else:
        display += "_"

print(display)
